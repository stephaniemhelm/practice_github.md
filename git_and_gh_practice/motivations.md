Motivations to change career:
I am at a point in my life where I am ready, willing, and able to make big changes.  I divorced my husband two years ago.  After that, I was able to begin working from home.  I have two children.  I needed to be able to support us but I also wanted to be able to be home when they were sick, snow days, or summer vacation.  I love working from home.
Now I am ready for a challenge.  I am so thankful that Turing can be done from a remote location and that employers are hiring so many remote developers.  
I am beyond excited for this new adventure!
